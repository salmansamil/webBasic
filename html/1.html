	Why learn HTML?
Every webpage you look at is written in a language called HTML. You can think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. In this course, we'll use HTML to add paragraphs, headings, images and links to a webpage.

In the editor to the right, there's a tab called test.html. This is the file we'll type our HTML into. See the code with the <>s? That's HTML! Like any language, it has its own special syntax (rules for communicating).

When we press Save & Submit Code, the results tab will act like an Internet browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer). A browser's job is to transform the code in test.html into a recognizable webpage! It knows how to lay out the page by following the HTML syntax.
