<!-- What if you wanted to send the user to another part of your website, or another website altogether? You use hyperlinks, or links for short!

<a href="https://www.codecademy.com">My Favorite Site!</a>
First, there's an opening <a> tag and that tag has an attribute called href. The href value tells your link where you want it to go, in this case https://www.codecademy.com.
Then you have a description of your link between your opening <a> and your closing </a> tags. This is what you will be able to click on.
Finally, you have your closing </a> tag. -->
